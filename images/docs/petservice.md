## **Global Market Overview: Growth and Regional Dynamics**

Pet services – which include grooming, boarding/daycare, training, pet sitting/walking, insurance, and other non-food pet care offerings – make up a significant and growing segment of the overall pet industry. In **2024, the global pet services market was valued at about $43–45 billion**, accounting for roughly 12–13% of total pet-related spending worldwide (the broader **pet care economy** was estimated over $320 billion). Demand is projected to rise steadily: by **2025 the pet services market is around $45.6 billion**, and it is **forecast to reach $66 billion+ by 2032** – representing a healthy \~5.5% compound annual growth rate. This growth is underpinned by surging pet ownership, “pet parenting” attitudes, and willingness to spend on pet well-being across many countries.

**North America**’s outsized market reflects high pet ownership and spending: for instance, U.S. consumers were expected to spend over **$150 billion on their pets in 2024**, with about one-quarter on veterinary care and roughly **$18–20 billion on other services (grooming, boarding, training, walking, etc.)**. Europe is similarly pet-centric; by 2025 Europe’s pet services are valued around **$13.2 billion**, supported by the trend of treating pets as family members and paying more for their care. **Asia-Pacific** markets, while currently smaller, are expanding rapidly – China’s pet service sector is growing \~6–7% annually (faster than GDP) amid a boom in pet ownership by young professionals, and countries like **India** are seeing a surge of pet care startups and services in urban centers. [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/) [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/)


*Market size figures cover services like boarding, grooming, training, sitting, insurance, etc., and exclude pet food and product sales. CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate.* **Dogs** account for the largest share of spending – e.g. dogs made up \~45% of the global pet services market by pet type in 2024 – since dog owners tend to utilize grooming, training, and boarding services more frequently. That said, services for **cats** are growing as well, as cats become popular pets in urban areas (cats are a majority of pets in Europe). [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/), [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460)

**Service categories:** Among service types, **pet boarding & daycare** (including kennels, pet hotels, “doggy daycares”) has emerged as the largest segment, comprising about **31%** of the market. This is fueled by busy pet parents who need care for their animals during workdays or travel. **Grooming** (haircuts, baths, nail trims, etc.) is another core service showing solid growth (\~5.6% CAGR) as owners invest in their pets’ hygiene and appearance – boosted by health benefits of grooming (e.g. preventing skin issues) and the “humanization” trend (premium spa-like treatments for pets). **Pet sitting and walking** services (often provided in-home or locally) and **training/behavior classes** are also important traditional offerings. In many Western countries, pet sitting/walking has become more visible with the rise of apps (discussed below) that connect pet owners with local caregivers. **Veterinary care** is sometimes counted separately from general pet services, but it’s worth noting veterinary services represent a substantial spend (over $38 billion in the U.S. for 2023). Vet clinics themselves are evolving with new technology and practice models, which we will cover in the B2B trends section. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/)

**Market drivers:** The overall expansion of pet services is driven by several factors: **pet ownership rates are climbing** (e.g. \~66% of U.S. households now have a pet, the highest ever), and pets are increasingly seen as family members whose care is non-negotiable. **Urbanization and changing lifestyles** also boost demand – in cities, busy professionals rely on services like dog walkers, pet daycare, and grooming salons due to lack of time and space. Rising middle-class incomes, especially in Asia and Latin America, mean more people can afford such services. Furthermore, **pet health and wellness awareness** has grown; owners are more proactive about grooming, training, and regular vet check-ups, treating them as essential to pet well-being. These cultural shifts, combined with the convenience of new digital service platforms, are propelling steady growth in the sector. [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/) [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460)

On the other hand, the industry isn't without challenges. **Labor shortages and costs** are a concern – experienced pet groomers, trainers, and veterinarians are in short supply relative to demand, pushing wages up. This can strain small pet service businesses and limit capacity. Additionally, **economic pressures** can make premium pet services (like luxury pet hotels or elaborate spa treatments) too expensive for some owners, creating price sensitivity in certain segments. Nevertheless, baseline services (basic grooming, routine vet care, boarding) are considered essential by many pet owners, making the industry relatively resilient. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel and office work paused (reducing demand for boarding), the sector rebounded as the pet population grew and people turned to remote services and e-commerce for pet needs.

## **Traditional Pet Services: Foundation of the Industry**

**Traditional pet services** – such as grooming, boarding, pet sitting, walking, and training – remain the backbone of the industry. These services have long been delivered through brick-and-mortar businesses or individual providers, and they continue to enjoy strong demand even as technology changes how they are accessed.

*   **Grooming:** Pet grooming is a staple service, encompassing fur trimming, bathing, nail clipping, and even pet spa treatments. Grooming keeps pets healthy (preventing matting, skin conditions, etc.) and owners increasingly view it as part of routine pet healthcare. The emphasis on pet wellness and cleanliness has even sparked a trend toward **“clean grooming”** – using natural, hypoallergenic products and eco-friendly techniques. Major pet retail chains like <span style="white-space:nowrap"><strong>Petco</strong></span> and <strong>PetSmart</strong> operate grooming salons in hundreds of stores, and many independent groomers and mobile grooming vans serve local communities. This segment is growing steadily (mid-single-digit growth rate) in line with pet ownership. For example, Europe’s rising health-consciousness among pet owners is boosting demand for grooming across the region. One challenge for grooming businesses is finding skilled groomers, as the job requires training and can be physically demanding. Despite that, grooming remains a **“needs-based” service that pet owners prioritize** even in tight economic times (dirty or overgrown pets are not fun for anyone), providing a stable revenue stream. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460), [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html), [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html)

*   **Boarding & Pet Sitting:** When pet owners travel or are unable to supervise their animals, they turn to boarding kennels, pet hotels, or pet sitters. **Boarding facilities** range from basic kennel runs to upscale pet resorts offering private suites, play yards, webcam monitoring, and even TV and bedtime stories for pets. This is the largest single service category at \~30% of market share. Growth in boarding and **daycare** is fueled by two trends: more pet owners see travel as a reason to find quality care for their pets, and more working owners use dog daycare during the week so their pets aren’t home alone all day. For instance, the surge in business and leisure travel in recent years has meant greater need for trustworthy boarding – owners are willing to pay for facilities that keep their pets safe and happy while they’re away. Traditional pet sitting (hiring someone to take care of the pet at home) is also popular, especially for cats or special-needs pets that might be less suited to kennel environments. Historically, finding reliable sitters or home boarders was done via word of mouth or local agencies; now, dedicated **mobile apps** (like Rover and Wag) have made pet sitting more accessible (more on this in the next section). The **pet daycare** concept (daily drop-off for dogs to play and socialize) has grown in urban centers, often in tandem with grooming and training services on-site. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460)

*   **Dog Walking:** Professional dog walking services have become common in cities, where busy owners hire walkers to give their dogs exercise during the day. What used to be an informal neighborhood business has been professionalized through companies and apps that schedule walks, track them via GPS, and handle payments. This service saw a boom as the number of dogs in apartments grew. Even though many people worked from home during the pandemic (reducing demand temporarily), dog walking has bounced back as owners return to offices or simply enjoy the convenience of outsourcing some exercise sessions. It’s a key part of the pet services mix in dense cities like New York, London, or Tokyo.

*   **Training & Behavior:** Services like obedience classes, puppy training, and behavior consulting address an important aspect of pet ownership. Well-behaved pets are easier to integrate into family life, so owners invest in training especially in the first year of pet ownership. Traditional group classes (at pet stores or training centers) and private trainers are widely available. There’s also an emerging market for **specialized training** (e.g. agility courses, therapy dog training) and even **pet coaching via video sessions**, as some trainers offer online consultations.

*   **Veterinary Care:** Veterinary services are sometimes categorized separately from general pet services, but they overlap (for example, many pet service businesses also offer preventative health services like vaccinations, and some vets offer grooming or boarding). Traditionally, vet care has been delivered through independent clinics. This is a huge expenditure category – in the U.S., veterinary services spending exceeded **$38 billion in 2023** – and it’s evolving (see B2B section). Routine vet services (check-ups, vaccinations, spay/neuter) are considered essential by owners, while advanced treatments (dentistry, surgeries, etc.) are growing as owners are willing to go the extra mile for pet health. A major issue in vet care is that **demand is outpacing supply of veterinarians**, leading to longer wait times for appointments and higher prices. This gap is giving rise to new solutions like telehealth and clinic networks (discussed later). [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/)

**Resilience and changes:** Traditional pet services have proven resilient over time – people need someone to groom fluffy or walk Fido regardless of the latest technology. However, **technology is increasingly augmenting how these services are delivered and discovered.** Booking a grooming appointment or finding a pet sitter has moved online, improving convenience. For example, Petco reported that **almost 50% of its customers now schedule grooming appointments online** (via app/website), and noted that if they don’t see a convenient opening, they might go elsewhere. This prompted Petco to upgrade its scheduling software to increase available time slots and flexibility, directly resulting in better customer retention. Traditional service providers are adapting by establishing an online presence, using pet business management software for scheduling and customer management, and listing services on aggregator platforms. The core services themselves – keeping pets clean, safe, exercised, and well-behaved – remain fundamentally the same, but **the way pet owners access and interact with these services is changing dramatically through digital innovation.** [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html) [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html), [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html)

## **Emerging Trends: Technology and Innovation in Pet Services**

The pet services sector is in the midst of a **technology-driven transformation**. In recent years, a wave of **digital platforms, mobile apps, and tech-enabled services** has made pet care more convenient and connected than ever before. Both consumers (pet owners) and service providers are embracing these innovations. Here we highlight key emerging trends and tech applications, on the consumer side and the B2B side:

### **1. On-Demand Platforms and Mobile Apps for Pet Owners**

Pet owners today can summon pet services at the touch of an app – part of the broader “Uberfication” of services. **Mobile apps and online marketplaces** have revolutionized how people find and book pet care:

*   **Pet Sitting & Dog Walking Apps:** *Marketplace* apps like **Rover** and **Wag** (in the U.S. and many other countries) connect pet owners with independent pet sitters and dog walkers. Through these platforms, owners can view vetted caregivers, read reviews, book pet sitting/boarding stays or walking sessions, and pay securely. This digital convenience has driven rapid growth – Rover, for example, grew into one of the leading pet care platforms and even went public via SPAC in 2021 (later valued at \~$2.3 billion when taken private by investors in 2023). These services tap into previously informal labor markets (neighbors or gig workers who love pets) and have greatly expanded the availability of pet care beyond traditional kennels. They are especially popular with younger, tech-savvy pet owners who prefer app-based services. However, the competitive landscape has been challenging: **Wag**, another dog-walker app that went public, saw its stock tumble after IPO, suggesting that while demand is high, profitability and differentiation are key issues for these startups. [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/)

*   **Grooming & Training at Your Doorstep:** Following the trend, there are apps that offer on-demand mobile grooming or training sessions at home. Startups have piloted models where you can schedule a groomer to come to your house via an app, or book a trainer for a home visit. This is still a niche, but growing in urban areas where convenience is paramount.

*   **Comprehensive Pet Care Apps:** Increasingly, apps aim to be one-stop shops for pet parents. These **integrated pet care platforms** allow users to manage various needs – find a vet, schedule a grooming, order pet food, track health records – all in one place. For example, some apps pair with **wearable devices** (smart collars or trackers on the pet) to monitor exercise and then offer suggestions for nearby dog parks or walkers if activity is low. In **India**, platforms like **Wagr** and **Petsfolio** have introduced mobile apps that combine services: they offer digital veterinary consultations, on-demand pet sitters/walkers, and other pet services through a single digital interface. This holistic approach indicates where the market is heading globally. [\[hcltech.com\]](https://www.hcltech.com/blogs/smart-pet-smarter-care-key-trends-reshaping-petcare)

*   **Retailer Apps and Online Scheduling:** Established pet service providers have also enhanced their digital offerings. Petco and PetSmart, for instance, encourage customers to book grooming or vet appointments via their mobile apps or websites. As noted, Petco’s app not only handles bookings but is tied into its membership loyalty program (Vital Care), sending reminders and personalized care tips. This omnichannel strategy (integrating in-store services with online convenience) has become crucial for traditional companies to stay competitive. [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html), [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html)

**Impact:** These digital platforms greatly improve convenience and transparency for pet owners. They also enlarge the overall market by drawing in pet owners who might not have used a formal service before. For example, someone who wouldn’t have gone through the effort of finding a kennel might be willing to book a home sitter on an app. The **user experience** – with GPS-tracked dog walks, photo updates of pets having fun, and easy re-booking – has raised expectations for service quality and communication. It’s pushing traditional providers to step up their tech game (e.g., sending “report cards” or pictures to owners during a boarding stay, which many kennels now do via email or app).

However, with convenience also comes the **gig economy challenges** – ensuring safety, quality, and trust. Platforms have had to invest in insurance, support, and vetting processes to build confidence. Overall, on-demand pet care apps are here to stay, and we can expect further growth and maybe consolidation in this segment as companies vie to become the go-to “Pet Super-App” for consumers.

### **2. Telehealth and Virtual Veterinary Services**

One of the most revolutionary changes in pet services is the advent of **veterinary telemedicine** and other remote health services for pets. Just as telehealth has transformed human healthcare, it is now doing the same for veterinary care – accelerated by the pandemic and the ongoing shortage of veterinarians.

*   **Rise of Telemedicine:** Telemedicine for pets typically involves pet owners connecting with licensed vets or vet techs via video call, phone, or chat to consult about non-emergency health issues. This can include getting advice on minor illnesses or behavior issues, follow-up consultations for ongoing conditions, or triage to determine if an in-person visit is needed. The **veterinary telehealth market is growing explosively**: it was valued around **$307 million in 2024 and is projected to reach nearly $2 billion by 2034 (20%+ CAGR)**. North America currently dominates this market (about 43% share), but usage is spreading worldwide. Telehealth addresses a critical problem: many areas have limited vet access or long wait times. By enabling pet owners to get professional advice quickly from home, it **bridges the supply-demand gap** in vet care. In fact, industry analysis suggests that to meet rising pet healthcare demand by 2030, clinics must increase productivity \~40%, and telemedicine is seen as a key tool to achieve that. [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market) [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/), [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/) [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/)

*   **Convenience & Use Cases:** Currently, telehealth is often used for **urgent but not life-threatening situations** (e.g., “my dog has an upset stomach, do I need to rush to the vet?”) and follow-ups. Going forward, it’s expected to expand into more diagnostic roles. For instance, vets can guide owners in performing simple exams at home, and some jurisdictions now allow veterinarians to **diagnose and prescribe** through teleconsultation after an initial in-person exam. Telehealth is also useful for routine check-ins, nutrition and training advice, and managing chronic conditions (like monthly arthritis progress updates), all without the pet undergoing the stress of travel. [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market), [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market)

*   **Integration with AI and IoT:** A major trend is integrating telehealth platforms with **AI diagnostic tools and IoT devices**. Wearable pet health monitors (like smart collars that track vital signs, activity, sleep, or devices such as smart litter boxes that monitor a cat’s urine output) can feed data to veterinarians remotely. Some telehealth services are now leveraging **AI-driven analysis** – for example, AI algorithms can analyze a pet’s symptoms or even examine uploaded photos/x-rays. Recent advances show AI can assist in reading radiology images (x-rays, ultrasound) to detect issues that vets might miss. This means a telehealth vet might one day review your dog’s x-ray uploaded from a mobile app with an AI “second set of eyes” helping flag anomalies. Such technology could make remote diagnosis more powerful. One vivid example: an AI tool helped vets quickly confirm a case of dog poisoning by analyzing scan results within minutes, enabling faster treatment. Big players are entering this space – for instance, **Walmart in the U.S. has added veterinary telehealth services** as part of its pet care offerings, alongside opening new physical pet service centers, to offer customers comprehensive care options. [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/), [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market) [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/) [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market)

*   **Challenges:** Telehealth for pets does face regulatory hurdles. Many regions require an existing Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR) – meaning the vet must have seen the pet in person recently – to prescribe medication or formally diagnose. This is slowly evolving, but it’s one reason most telehealth services limit themselves to advice unless a local clinic partner is involved. Another challenge is that pets can’t self-report symptoms, so telehealth relies heavily on owner observations and sometimes home monitoring tools. Despite this, the formula of combining **tele-triage + home monitoring + AI** is improving remote care reliability.

Overall, veterinary telehealth is expected to continue surging, especially as younger, digitally native pet owners embrace it. It **conveniently extends veterinary reach into the home**, providing peace of mind and quick guidance. Many veterinary clinic chains now incorporate telehealth as part of their offerings (for example, some pet insurance plans or pet wellness subscriptions include free telehealth consultations). Given its high growth rate, telehealth is poised to become a standard component of pet healthcare in the near future, complementing – not replacing – in-clinic visits.

### **3. AI, Data Analytics, and IoT in Pet Care**

Beyond telemedicine, a suite of emerging technologies is reshaping how we care for pets:

*   **Smart Collars & Wearables:** Pet wearables have become popular for tracking pets’ location and activity. GPS-enabled **smart collars** like Whistle, Fi, Tractive, or **Pawtrack** allow owners to locate a lost pet via smartphone and often track exercise levels. Some devices also monitor vital signs or body temperature. For example, there are smart harnesses and collars that can detect if a dog is scratching excessively (sign of allergies) or if a cat has not visited the litter box (possible illness). These IoT devices produce data that can be used for preventive care – e.g., sending an alert if a pet’s activity drops below normal, prompting a vet visit. **Real-time monitoring** through IoT is especially valuable for health conditions; a vet can be looped in via apps if something looks off, making pet care more proactive.

*   **Smart Feeders and Pet Home Devices:** The “smart home” extends to pets. **Smart pet feeders** can dispense food on a schedule and even adjust portions – some high-end models, like one by Furrfinity in India, use AI to tailor feeding to a pet’s needs and send alerts if the pet skips a meal. There are also IoT-connected water fountains that track water intake. **Smart litter boxes** for cats can self-clean and also log usage data to flag potential urinary issues. Gadgets like the **Halo smart fence** create virtual boundaries for dogs, with GPS collars that alert owners if the dog leaves a designated area. Pet doors with RFID sensors can restrict which pets (or critters) come in. Even pet entertainment has gone high-tech: interactive toys and treat dispensers (e.g., GoPro’s Fetch ball that emits lights and sounds) keep pets engaged and can be app-controlled. [\[hcltech.com\]](https://www.hcltech.com/blogs/smart-pet-smarter-care-key-trends-reshaping-petcare)

*   **AI for Health Diagnostics:** We touched on AI aiding vets in diagnostics. To expand, companies are developing AI tools to analyze **pet health data** at scale – from imaging (radiology, as noted) to patterns in lab results. There are AI-driven platforms that can examine a simple blood test or stool sample result and compare it to thousands of others to suggest likely health issues earlier. Some smartphone apps claim to use AI-based image recognition to identify skin problems or dental issues from photos of the pet (owners can take a picture of a lesion or a gum and get preliminary analysis). While many such tools are still emerging, they herald a future where AI assists pet professionals in **early detection** of diseases (for instance, noticing subtle changes in a dog’s gait from video that might indicate joint pain).

*   **Data Analytics & Personalization:** The proliferation of data (from wearables, apps, vet records, etc.) is allowing a more **data-driven approach to pet care**. Pet service businesses are leveraging analytics to personalize offerings. For example, grooming salons might use customer data to remind owners when Fluffy is due for her next trim (based on breed and last visit), or training apps might adjust lesson plans if progress data shows a dog mastering certain commands slowly. On a larger scale, pet insurers and wellness plan providers analyze data on breed-specific issues to create tailored preventive care packages. The industry is also analyzing macro data: for instance, where are gaps in vet services geographically? Which neighborhoods have high dog populations but few dog daycares? This opens new business opportunities for expansion.

*   **Automation and Robotics:** While still in early stages, there is experimentation with robotics in pet services. One notable example is **Tombot**, a company which raised funding to produce robotic companion dogs aimed at elder care and people who can’t care for a live pet. These aren’t services for real pets, but it shows the crossover of tech and pet companionship. In pet service facilities, automation may come in the form of robots that can help clean kennels or drones that monitor play yards – these are not mainstream yet, but pilot projects exist. [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/)

**Why it matters:** The infusion of AI and IoT means pet owners have **more tools to understand and manage their pets’ health and behavior**, often in real time. It complements traditional services: for instance, a boarding facility might use health-monitoring collars to keep an eye on senior pets under its care, or a vet might use AI to prioritize which test results need urgent follow-up. For B2B players, adopting these tech tools can improve efficiency (e.g., automatically tracking how many dogs are in daycare and for how long, for billing). Pet tech also appeals to the **new generation of pet owners** (Millennials, Gen Z) who are very comfortable with technology and expect digital solutions. These owners are driving demand for tech-enabled convenience – surveys show younger pet owners are more likely to insure their pets and use apps for care, reflecting a proactive and tech-centric approach.

### **4. Subscription Models and Services-as-Subscription**

Building on trends in e-commerce, many pet services and products are moving to **subscription-based models** to create steady revenue and convenience for customers:

*   **Subscription Boxes and Auto-Ship:** Companies like **BarkBox** popularized monthly subscription boxes for pets (toys, treats delivered to your door). In services, one of the simplest but most effective models is **auto-ship subscriptions for pet food, medication, and supplies**. Retailers (Chewy, Amazon, Petco) heavily promote auto-shipment programs where owners subscribe to have food or litter delivered at regular intervals, often at a slight discount. This not only ensures pets never run out of essentials but also ties customers into an ecosystem. Auto-ship has become so prevalent that it drove a significant portion of pet e-commerce growth – for example, easy online ordering with free shipping has helped U.S. pet e-commerce sales climb to an estimated $37.8 billion in 2025 (nearly 30% of total pet spend), with **subscription convenience cited by over 60% of pet owners** as a reason for moving purchases online. While this mostly concerns products, it affects services indirectly: many companies bundle services with product subscriptions (e.g. Chewy offers free telehealth consults for customers who use auto-ship for medications). [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/), [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/)

*   **Pet Wellness Memberships:** Perhaps the biggest shift in services is the rise of **membership programs for pet care**. These are akin to a “gym membership” but for vet and wellness services. For example, Petco’s **Vital Care** program (relaunching in 2026 in enhanced form) provides routine vet exams, discounts on grooming, and other perks for a monthly or annual fee. Veterinary clinic chains and startups have similar plans: **Small Door Veterinary**, a U.S. startup, operates members-only veterinary clinics where clients pay a subscription for 24/7 telehealth, same-day appointments, preventative care, and discounts on procedures. This model just attracted **$55 million in Series B funding in 2025** to expand tech-enabled, membership-based vet care across multiple cities. The appeal is twofold: pet owners get a **predictable care plan** and VIP service, while providers get recurring revenue and can encourage proactive care (which leads to healthier pets and more services used in the long run). [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html), [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/)

*   **Insurance and Wellness Plans:** Pet **insurance** can also be thought of as a subscription model for covering services. Pet insurance uptake is growing quickly from a low base – only \~3% of pets in the U.S. are insured, but that’s rising at \~16% CAGR as vet costs climb. Younger owners are far more likely to buy pet insurance (Gen Z 31% have it vs. only 8% of Boomers). Insurers and retailers are partnering to bundle insurance with other services. Notably, **Petco partnered with Nationwide** (a major pet insurer) in 2024 to offer new pet insurance plans through Petco’s channels. Chewy launched CarePlus insurance in collaboration with another insurer, integrating it on their site. Some insurance plans now include coverage for wellness visits or even grooming, blurring lines with direct service subscriptions. [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/) [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/)

*   **Training and Content Subscriptions:** Another model is subscription-based access to training videos, live Q\&A with trainers, or premium content for pet care. Apps and websites offer monthly plans for unlimited dog training advice or behavioral consultation.

The movement toward subscription models indicates a shift from one-off transactions to **ongoing customer relationships** in pet care. For pet owners, subscriptions simplify budgeting and ensure regular care (e.g., you’re prompted to use that grooming discount every month). For businesses, it’s about loyalty and lifetime value – if a customer is locked into a plan, they are less likely to shop around for services elsewhere. The success of such models depends on delivering consistent value. There have been some hiccups – for instance, public market performance of some subscription-based pet companies like BarkBox has been weak (Bark’s stock fell \~86% since 2020), suggesting profitability can be an issue. Still, the high retention rates reported by newer entrants (a German pet food subscription startup noted **80% of surveyed pet owners use subscription pet food** services, showing strong adoption in that vertical) show that **“set it and forget it” convenience is very attractive to pet parents**. [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/)

We’re likely to see more services packaged into subscriptions or memberships in the future, from preventive care bundles to unlimited daycare passes, as companies seek to stabilize revenue and integrate themselves into every aspect of pet ownership.

### **5. New Niches and Specialized Services**

Innovation in pet services is also leading to **brand-new niches** and creative offerings that didn’t exist a decade ago:

*   **Pet Tech Wellness Startups:** Companies are emerging that focus on very specialized pet wellness areas – e.g., **pet longevity and biotech**. The startup Loyal, which is working on drugs to extend dogs’ lifespans, raised $40 million in funding in 2024. While not a “service” in the traditional sense, it reflects a broader trend of applying advanced science to pet care, potentially yielding future services like genetic testing, regenerative medicine for pets, etc. Another example: Australian startup **Elita** offers to collect and bank stem cells from pets during routine vet procedures, so that those cells can later be used in regenerative therapies if the pet develops arthritis or other conditions – essentially bringing cutting-edge human medical tech into the pet domain. These kinds of services are still premium and niche, but they point to a future where pets benefit from high-tech health solutions. [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/), [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/)

*   **Teletraining and Behavior Services:** With so many pandemic pets and first-time pet owners in recent years, demand for training and behaviorists has grown. A niche of **“teletraining”** has popped up – services where a certified trainer can coach owners via Zoom on how to handle issues like separation anxiety or leash pulling. This makes professional advice more accessible, especially in areas without many trainers.

*   **Pet Travel and Relocation Services:** As people move around with pets more, companies now specialize in handling the logistics of pet travel (from paperwork to safe transport). Some startups and agencies provide door-to-door pet relocation across the globe, which is a growing need in an increasingly mobile world.

*   **End-of-Life and Hospice Care:** A somber but important area of pet services is end-of-life care. Mobile vet hospice services will come to the home to help pets in their final days in a comfortable setting and provide euthanasia when the time comes. There’s growing acknowledgement of pet hospice as a service, and some veterinarians specialize in this, often operating via house-call models.

*   **Pet Events and Entertainment:** Pet parties, pet yoga classes, doga (yoga with dogs), and even pet weddings – entrepreneurs are creating services around the social and fun aspects of pet ownership. While these may not be massive market segments, they show how deeply integrated pets are in owners’ lives, spawning mini-industries around them.

Overall, the proliferation of new services indicates a **broadening of what “pet services” entails**, far beyond basic grooming and vet visits. Pet owners can now find solutions tailored to almost any need or lifestyle, and this diversification opens up new business opportunities.

***

## **New Business Opportunities and Partnerships**

The dynamic trends in pet services have given rise to significant **business opportunities**. Companies old and new are capitalizing on pet parents’ willingness to spend, forging partnerships, and innovating on monetization strategies:

*   **Retailers Expanding into Services:** Traditional pet supply retailers (and even general retailers) see services as a growth avenue and a way to build customer loyalty. **Petco and PetSmart** have long offered in-store grooming, training, and vet clinics, but now even mass retailers like **Walmart** are entering the fray. In late 2024, Walmart launched multiple pet service centers in their stores (offering grooming, vet care, etc.) in states like Arizona and Georgia, coupling this with new pet telehealth and pharmacy offerings. The strategic logic: services bring pet owners into stores (or onto apps) more frequently, and service customers are likely to become product buyers as well. As Petco’s CEO noted, services create a “competitive moat” and drive repeat foot traffic. We can expect further **omnichannel integration**, where a retailer’s online ecosystem seamlessly ties into booking pet services and selling related products (e.g., buy a grooming package and get a discount on shampoos). [\[precedence...search.com\]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/veterinary-telehealth-market) [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html), [\[finance.yahoo.com\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petco-improves-offerings-plans-membership-170600009.html)

*   **Cross-Industry Partnerships:** Companies are partnering to offer more holistic pet care solutions. A prime example is the **Petco–Rover partnership**: Petco (brick-and-mortar retailer) teamed up with Rover (online pet-sitting marketplace) so that Petco’s customers could find pet sitters and dog walkers via Rover’s network directly through Petco’s website. This kind of partnership leverages each side’s strengths – Petco provides trust and reach, Rover provides the service network – resulting in a win-win and a one-stop experience for pet owners. Another example is Petco’s partnership with an insurer (Nationwide) to bundle insurance, as mentioned. **Chewy**, primarily an e-commerce giant, has partnered with or acquired service-oriented companies (it offers a telehealth service called “Connect with a Vet” and has invested in its own insurance product in partnership with Trupanion). We also see **veterinary clinic groups partnering with financing companies** to offer payment plans, or with insurance companies for direct billing – all aimed at making pet care more financially accessible. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/)

*   **Consolidation and Franchise Growth:** In a fragmented sector (many small grooming salons, independent vets, etc.), bigger players are consolidating. Large veterinary groups (some backed by corporate parents or private equity) are acquiring local clinics to form networks capable of investing in technology and standardized practices. For instance, only about 40% of U.S. general vet practices remain independent, and acquisitions continue as clinics join larger groups for efficiency. On the consumer services side, franchising is a route to scale: companies like **Camp Bow Wow** (dog daycare/boarding franchise) expanded nationwide through franchise locations, and it was acquired by Propelled Brands in 2023 to continue growing. **Destination Pet**, another U.S. firm, has been on an acquisition spree, buying up regional boarding businesses (e.g., it acquired Pet Palace in 2023). This consolidation presents opportunities for entrepreneurs to either join a franchise or position their business for acquisition. At the same time, it means more unified standards and possibly higher investments in each service location (for example, a chain can afford better facilities or management software than a mom-and-pop kennel might). [\[forbes.com\]](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/18/five-emerging-trends-in-pet-health-care-for-2024-and-beyond/) [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460)

*   **Emerging Markets and Localization:** There are huge opportunities in **emerging pet markets** (Asia, Latin America). As mentioned, India and China are seeing a rise in pet-centric startups. Indian startups like **Paws & Collars** and **Paw Space** have gained traction by tailoring services (from grooming spas to pet matchmaking events) to the local culture and are expanding services in urban centers. In places where formal pet services were rare a decade ago, an entire ecosystem is now developing. Local entrepreneurs who understand regional pet owner needs (e.g., offering air-conditioned boarding in hot climates, or training tailored to local breeds) are finding a growing customer base. International investors are watching these markets; for example, Chinese pet service apps and boutique hotel chains for pets have attracted funding as that market grows at \~6% annually. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/article/the-future-of-the-global-pet-sector/)

*   **Monetization through Data and Ancillary Services:** With digital platforms, companies are also monetizing **data and ancillary services**. Pet service apps gather valuable data about pet health, breed behaviors, etc., which can inform product development (even selling anonymized insights to pet food or pharma companies). Many platforms have added **advertising or cross-selling** – for instance, an app might recommend pet insurance after you book a vet visit, earning referral fees. Others partner with vets such that they get a cut if the app referral leads to a clinic appointment. We’re also seeing the line between product and service blur: for example, dog DNA test companies now offer follow-up nutritional plans or wellness coaching as a service after you test your pet. **Community and content** can be a business too: some apps have premium content subscriptions (training videos, live vet Q\&As) as a revenue stream.

*   **Investor Interest and Funding Trends:** The pet tech and services space saw a surge of venture capital interest in the late 2010s and early 2020s. By 2024, funding had cooled somewhat – Crunchbase data showed that pet startups raised about $500 million in the first half of 2024, on track for a multi-year low. This is partly due to market conditions and investors being more cautious after some high-profile pet startups underperformed post-IPO (e.g. Wag, Bark as noted). Nonetheless, critical deals are still happening in 2024–2025, particularly in health and tech: **MoeGo**, a software platform for pet groomers to manage their business, raised a $24 million Series A in 2024, underscoring confidence in B2B solutions. **Small Door Vet** raised $55 M in 2025 as mentioned, and various pet telehealth and insurance startups have closed funding rounds. The overall sentiment is that while venture funding for “pet luxuries” might have cooled, there’s still strong backing for companies solving core problems (health, logistics, software) in this large and growing market. Indeed, no one expects pet spending by consumers to drop – it’s more about finding the right business models to capture that spend sustainably. [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/), [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/) [\[news.crunchbase.com\]](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/pet-startup-funding-slowed-2024-loyal-sploot/) [\[globalpeti...dustry.com\]](https://globalpetindustry.com/news/fresh-capital-recent-funding-rounds-shaping-the-pet-industry/)

In summary, the business landscape in pet services is lively: traditional companies are reinventing themselves to stay relevant, startups are addressing new needs and niches, and investors/partners are selectively supporting ideas that promise scale or improved margins. The convergence of retail, healthcare, and tech in the pet domain means we’ll continue to see interesting partnerships (like insurers with retailers, or tech firms with vet chains) as each tries to capture a piece of this **humanization-of-pets driven boom**.

***

## **Competitive Landscape: Major Players and Innovators**

The pet services industry is highly fragmented but increasingly featuring some **stand-out players** across different categories. Here’s an overview of the competitive landscape, covering both consumer-facing brands and B2B solution providers:

**Key competitive observations:**

*   There is a **convergence of sectors**: Retailers are now major service providers (Petco, PetSmart adding more health services), while traditionally product-focused companies like Chewy are adding services, and vice versa (service companies selling products or plans). This means competition can come from unexpected angles (your pet’s groomer might also try to sell you pet food on subscription; your pet food store now wants to handle your vet appointments).

*   **Brand and trust** matter, especially in services involving pet health or pet sitting (owners won’t leave Fluffy with just anyone). Established players with trusted brands (e.g., vet chains, or franchises known for quality) have an edge in convincing customers to try additional services. New apps and startups often use promotions and referrals to build trust and awareness.

*   **Local vs Global**: Pet services often have to be delivered locally (you can’t outsource dog walking overseas!). So, despite global players existing, local markets see local competition. For instance, Rover might dominate in the U.S., but in some countries local startups or even classified-ad platforms might be more commonly used for finding pet sitters. Similarly, a big vet chain might own clinics in many regions, but independent vets still compete by offering personalized service.

*   **Differentiation through specialization**: Many successful companies differentiate by specializing deeply in one area, then expanding. For example, *Camp Bow Wow* built a strong franchise around just daycare/boarding with a standardized model, *Wag Hotels* (despite the name, not related to the Wag app) focuses on upscale pet hotels in California, and *Fetch! Pet Care* (in the U.S.) specializes in in-home pet sitting with a network of local franchisees. On the tech side, a company like *Trupanion* (insurance) focuses on pet medical insurance and integrates with vet payment systems, while *Pumpkin* (cited in Forbes) ties insurance with preventive care products. These focused strategies show that the market is broad enough to support many niches. [\[fortunebus...sights.com\]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-services-market-112460)

*   **Global players making moves**: There are a few international expansions happening. Rover extended into Europe by acquiring a EU pet-sitting startup. Some U.S. grooming/daycare franchises are looking abroad. Meanwhile, European and Asian companies are entering the U.S. (for example, Japan’s **Aibo** robot dog isn’t exactly a competitor in “services,” but shows how even consumer electronics giants see opportunity in the pet space; or Europe’s Tractive expanding GPS tracker subscriptions to the U.S.). The pet services marketplace is becoming more interconnected globally, especially via online platforms.

*   **Investment and M\&A**: As noted, mergers and acquisitions are frequent. Big conglomerates like Mars have acquired pet hospitals and even pet DNA test companies; Nestlé (Purina) invests in pet startups; private equity firms have bought and merged dog daycare chains. Startups that prove their concept often get snapped up by larger entities looking to round out their offerings. This means the competitive field can shift quickly – today’s innovative startup could be tomorrow’s arm of a large pet company.

For pet owners, this competition is largely beneficial: it means **more choices, better prices or value (as companies compete for loyalty), and improved service quality**. For the companies, it means a need to continuously innovate and differentiate, as the pet services space grows more crowded and sophisticated.

***

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the pet services industry is thriving and transforming in equal measure. **Globally, the market is growing steadily** as pets take on an even more important role in households and owners devote greater resources to their care. Traditional services like grooming, boarding, and veterinary care remain essential – the “basics” that will always underpin the industry – but they are being delivered in new ways thanks to technology and evolving consumer expectations.

Several **major trends** emerge from our analysis:

*   **Humanization & Premiumization:** Pets are family, and pet parents seek services that mirror human-quality experiences – from salon-grade grooming to specialized medical treatments. This drives both premium offerings (luxury spas, advanced surgeries) and a general expectation of high service quality and personalization.

*   **Digital Convenience:** The adoption of mobile apps, telehealth, and IoT in pet care is making pet services more convenient and accessible than ever. Busy pet owners can now offload tasks or get expert help with unprecedented ease. The businesses that harness digital tools effectively (for customer booking, service delivery, or operations) are reaping rewards in customer loyalty.

*   **Integration & Ecosystem Play:** We see a trend towards **integrated pet care ecosystems** – companies want to serve multiple needs under one umbrella, hoping to lock in customers. This could be a retail chain adding every service imaginable, or an app that becomes a one-stop pet care hub. For consumers, integrated offerings can mean a smoother experience and potentially cost savings (via bundled plans).

*   **Innovation Opening New Frontiers:** From AI diagnostics to stem cell banking and pet robots, innovation continues to open new frontiers. Some will remain niche, but others will gradually enter the mainstream, especially those that solve clear pain points (like vet access or behavior issues).

*   **Global Growth with Local Flavor:** While the U.S. leads in spending, **emerging markets** are the growth engines of the future. Pet services in Asia and Latin America will expand rapidly, often adapted to local culture and needs. Companies looking for growth are eyeing these regions, whether through investment or local partnerships. Meanwhile, mature markets will see more depth – more diverse services and competitive refinement.

*   **Resilience and Opportunity:** Perhaps one of the most reassuring insights is that the pet services sector has proven quite resilient to economic swings. Pet spending tends to hold up even when consumers tighten budgets elsewhere, because pet owners strongly prioritize their pets’ well-being. This “recession-resistant” nature makes the industry attractive for business investment. And with tens of millions of new pets adopted in recent years, demographic momentum is on its side.

Going forward, expect to see **greater collaboration between veterinarians, technologists, and service entrepreneurs** as the lines between “tech” and “touch” in pet care blur. A simple trip to the groomer might involve an app-based check-in and a health report generated by algorithms – and that might be normal. The companies that succeed will be those that **combine compassion and convenience**, leveraging innovation without losing the personal touch that pet owners value.

In sum, the pet services industry in 2025 and beyond is not only **big business** – it’s also an exciting space of continuous innovation, all oriented around a singular mission: delivering better care and experiences for our beloved animal companions. Given current trends, the future looks bright for pets and pet service providers alike, with growth and *tail*-winds (pun intended) carrying the industry forward.
